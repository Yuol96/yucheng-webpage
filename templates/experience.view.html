            "One-shot Object Detection" is intended to detect untrained objects among images or videos given a template img/video of the target object. I found a Siamese Region Proposal Network aimed at object tracking from <a href="http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Li_High_Performance_Visual_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf" target="_blank">a CVPR18 paper</a> which showed great promise for this project. I implemented this model and adapted it for object detection tasks, but it did not work. Following common practices for analyzing deep networks, I analyzed intermediate outputs and realized that it was the lack of generalizability that impeded the training process. To tackle this problem, I changed the backbone CNN module to improve model capacity, which luckily increased the mean average precision performance significantly. Furthermore, by visualizing the detection outcomes, I analyzed the false positive bounding boxes and concluded that the datasets for object detection exhibited more variations and thus gave rise to more inter-class misclassification. To address this problem, I redesigned the hard sample mining strategy to help focus the training on differentiating objects of different categories. Moreover, I borrowed the “attention” idea from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06521" target="_blank">an ECCV18 paper</a> and introduced a Convolutional Block Attention Module to help the model concentrate on potential regions and refine the feature maps.

            <br>
            <div>In this work, we present Eiffel, an integrated visual analytics system that applies triple summarizations on evolutionary influence graphs in the nodal, relational and temporal dimensions. Through numerical experiments, Eiffel summarization results are shown to outperform that of traditional clustering algorithms on the trade-off of influence flow based and content based objectives. Moreover, a flow map representation is proposed and adapted to the case of influence graph summarization, which supports two modes of evolutionary visualization (i.e., flip-book and movie) to expedite the analysis of influence graph dynamics. We conducted two controlled user experiments to evaluate our technique on the influence graph summarization and visualization respectively, and showcased the system in two typical scenarios for evolutionary influence analysis, one on the citation influence graph of scientific papers and the other on the social interaction graph triggered by emerging online events. The results demonstrate the value of Eiffel in the visual analysis of evolutionary influence graphs.</div>

            <div>We present a benchmark system, DSAB, to conduct benchmark evaluation of sketch-based algorithms. We survey and classify sketch-based algorithms into three categories and describe 11 specific algorithms from these three categories. We have implemented 35 variants of these algorithms, which we have evaluated using our benchmark system to obtain metrics for accuracy, memory usage, throughput, generality, and simplicity. We compare these results to different configurations of the same algorithm, different algorithms in the same category, and across all algorithms. Based on these comparisons, our work presents insights and guidelines about existing sketch-based algorithms. The online platform for evaluation and comparison is available on a website and all source code has been released on GitHub.</div>

            <div>Heterostructures based on graphene and other 2D atomic crystals exhibit fascinating properties and intriguing potential in flexible optoelectronics, where graphene films function as transparent electrodes and other building blocks are used as photoactive materials. However, large‐scale production of such heterostructures with superior performance is still in early stages. Herein, for the first time, the preparation of a submeter‐sized, vertically stacked heterojunction of lead iodide (PbI2)/graphene on a flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film by vapor deposition of PbI2 on graphene/PET substrate at a temperature lower than 200 °C is demonstrated. This film is subsequently used to fabricate bendable graphene/PbI2/graphene sandwiched photodetectors, which exhibit high responsivity (45 A W−1 cm−2), fast response (35 µs rise, 20 µs decay), and high‐resolution imaging capability (1 µm). This study may pave a facile pathway for scalable production of high‐performance flexible devices.</div>

            <br>
            <div>The atomically thin 2D nature of suspended graphene membranes holds promising in numerous technological applications. In particular, the outstanding transparency to electron beam endows graphene membranes great potential as a candidate for specimen support of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). However, major hurdles remain to be addressed to acquire an ultraclean, high-intactness, and defect-free suspended graphene membrane. Here, a polymer-free clean transfer of sub-centimeter-sized graphene single crystals onto TEM grids to fabricate large-area and high-quality suspended graphene membranes has been achieved. Through the control of interfacial force during the transfer, the intactness of large-area graphene membranes can be as high as 95%, prominently larger than reported values in previous works. Graphene liquid cells are readily prepared by π–π stacking two clean single-crystal graphene TEM grids, in which atomic-scale resolution imaging and temporal evolution of colloid Au nanoparticles are recorded. This facile and scalable production of clean and high-quality suspended graphene membrane is promising toward their wide applications for electron and optical microscopy.</div>

            <br>
            <div>Two-dimensional (2D) layered hybrid perovskites of (RNH3)2PbX4 (R is an alkyl and X is a halide) have been recently synthesized and exhibited rich optical properties including fluorescence and exciton effects. However, few studies on transport and optoelectronic measurements of individual 2D perovskite crystals have been reported, presumably owing to the instability issue during electronic device fabrications. Here we report the first photodetector based on individual 2D (C4H9NH3)2PbBr4 perovskite crystals, built with the protection and top contact of graphene film. Both a high responsivity (∼2100 A/W) and extremely low dark current (∼10–10 A) are achieved with a design of interdigital graphene electrodes. Our study paves the way to build high-performance optoelectronic devices based on the emerging 2D single-crystal perovskite materials.</div>
